# Reducing Child Mortality if Africa - Living Goods
## High level description of project.
**What Living Goods does**: Living Goods gives Community Health Promoters (CHPs) in Uganda and Kenya basic health training. The CHPs visit households in their communities, registering pregnancies, giving basic medical advice (pregnancy best practices, how to administer medications), making diagnoses, and referring to clinics when necessary.

**The data**: CHPs record data on smartphones. The data is generated by encounters between CHPs and households, including pregnancy registrations, visits during pregnancy, referrals, symptoms, and diagnoses. There is also some demographic data and other metadata.
## What question or problem are you trying to solve?
LG focuses around helping CHPs prioritize which households to visit.
The goal is reducing child mortality of children under 5 years of age.
Two stages are important:
 1. Pregnancy: detect early signals for potential pregnancy problems like early birth, low weight at birth, still births.
 2. First 5 years of life.
## How will you present your work?
  - Visualization of significant findings through slides
## What are your data sources?
The data has already been made available by the organization through a set of 14 csv files that represent a full dump
Of the data they have at disposition. We would be dealing with a total of little over 2 millions records.
## What's your next step towards making this your project.
  - I've already established contact with the organization. The next step would be to meet with them and decide on a specific, achievable in 2/3 weeks, and from their perspective also meaningful, deliverable.


# Live Sentiment Detection of a Chat Bot to Customer Conversation - Cybrid Industries
## High level description of project.
Cybrid is a chat bot that automatize the early stages of interaction with a customer: it's a sales person that never sleeps and works 24/7. Cybrids can be trained through a dashboard where it is taught how to answer specific users questions.
The training is done by the user, associating responses to users classes of questions. The appropriate response is than picked by IBM Watson, who's able to understand user's questions and map them to the appropriate answer.
## What question or problem are you trying to solve?
The answer response pattern is currently not able to detect conversation nuances that could contain precious information about how the contact with the customer is going.
It would be very helpful to be able to detect **sentiment of the conversation** Cybrids has with a user so that the bot could be trained accordingly to respond to different "moods".
## How will you present your work?
  - Web app: it would be very nice to have a live demo that shows the sentiment of a real conversation with the Bot as it happens on the screen
  - Visualization & Presentation - slides would complement the presentation
## What are your data sources?
  - Cybridindustries could provide the history of Bot-User chats, inclusive of lead outcome for a total of almost 10,000 of them.
## What's your next step towards making this your project.
  - Getting the data and familiarizing with the tool
  - Having another meeting with Cybrid's stakeholders to define more specifically what the desired outcome should be, in order for them to be able to integrate it in their business and profit from it.


# Predicting Win Probability of Sales Opportunities - Trivadis AG
## High level description of project.
Trivadis is an IT service company, consulting customers in the DACH region (Deutschland, Austria, Switzerland).
It offers services that span from infrastructure to business intelligence and education to business consulting.
Leads and opportunities are tracked in its CRM and worked accordingly to a win probability as recorded by each sale person.
## What question or problem are you trying to solve?
We would like to have a better way to estimate an opportunity win probability other than a sale person's gut feeling.
It would also be very interesting to integrate a model's output, with a human's judgment to yield probably an event more accurate prediction.
## How will you present your work?
  - Web app or dashboard that lists all opportunities in the sales pipeline with their win probability
  - Visualization & Presentation - slides would complement the presentation
## What are your data sources?
  - Full history of CRM data (almost 33,000 opportunities, 30,000 leads and little over 200,000 sales activities)
## What's your next step towards making this your project.
  - Anonymizing the data and asking my company for permission to use them (already have, but a confirmation is better)
  - Might also want to involve some of my managers to involve them in the process
